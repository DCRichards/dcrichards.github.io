            <p>Technology is <strong>crazy</strong>, the other day they <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/3Dratchet_wrench/#.VLZ59oqsU4Q">3D printed a wrench</a> in space. Needless to say B&amp;Q are going to have to do well to top that. The novelty of being able to find every screw and fitting ever created in human history has <em>nothing</em> on NASA printing tools in space.</p>

  <p>BREAK. <em>How have you already digressed to DIY jokes, you've only just started blogging?</em></p>

<p>Sorry, back on topic. Basically, despite spending a number of years now doing <em>software development</em>, <em>coding</em>, <em>computer science</em>, <em>bug creating</em> or whatever title you want to give it, writing code that does stuff still continues to blow my mind a bit. And more interestingly it's both the code and the stuff that blows my mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started this blog for various reasons, some of them in the hope of being a little more <em>hip</em> and <em>cool</em>. But aside from that, because I thought it would be cool to have this place as my sort of rubber duck. Somewhere to just throw it out there and to just keep track of interesting things I discover and maybe even create. I often find myself <del>jokingly</del> reasonably seriously asking <em>what's the worst that could happen?!</em> So let's find out, here's to giving this thing a go.</p>

  <p>Rubber Ducks?</p>

<p>The title comes from the idea of <a href="http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/">rubber duck debugging</a>. If you've ever solved a problem or fixed a bug through talking to yourself or a colleague or clueless friend without them saying a word, then you've joined the <strong>rubber duck club</strong>.</p>
